\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Brief description of the task}
The goal of this laboratory was to introduce students to the principles of memory management
in operating systems. As last time, a MOSS simultor came in handy for that purpose (Memory Management simultor to be more precise).
Laboratory's main task was to map any 8 pages of physical memory to the first 8 pages of virtual memory and then run simulation
to read each of 64 virtual memory pages.

\subsection{Environment description and configuration}
Simulator was configured in \texttt{memory.conf} file. Simulation environment consists of 64 virtual pages and 32 physical pages. Page size was defined as 16384 B.
Pages were mapped in the following way:

\noindent
\ttfamily
memset 0 0 0 0 0 0\\
memset 1 1 0 0 0 0      \\
memset 2 10 0 0 0 0      \\
memset 3 11 0 0 0 0      \\
memset 4 21 0 0 0 0      \\
memset 5 22 0 0 0 0      \\
memset 6 30 0 0 0 0      \\
memset 7 31 0 0 0 0
\rmfamily
.

The only columns that matter in these \texttt{memset} commands are the first and the second --
the first is a number of virtual page and the latter is the number of physical page mapped to
that virtual page.

The last part of setup was \texttt{commands} file. It describes the way simultion should work,
e.g. writing and reading data to/from specific memory addresses. For this laboratory it was set up
to read one virtual memory address from each of 64 virtual pages. Here is a sample of that file:

\noindent
\ttfamily
READ hex 0\\
READ hex 4000\\
READ hex 8000\\
READ hex C000\\
READ hex 10000\\
READ hex 14000\\
READ hex 18000\\
READ hex 1C000\\
READ hex 20000
\rmfamily
.

As page size was set to 16384 B, in order to read one address of each page simulation had
to read a one memory cell every  16384 B. As it is 4000$_{16}$ B, starting from 0x0 next addresses
are 0x4000, 0x8000, 0xC000, etc.
